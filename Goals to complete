# Goals for Computational Framework Development
## Error-Tolerant File Handling
Develop mechanisms that can identify and correct misspelled filenames, ensuring seamless file retrieval and execution.
## Dynamic Excel Data Mapping
Implement a dynamic data search feature within Excel tables that removes the dependency on static column positions, thereby allowing more versatile dataset integration.
## Modular Code Execution
Design the code architecture to be modular, allowing users to execute specific components independently, thereby skipping stages that have either been completed or are not necessary for a given task.
## Convolutional Neural Network Architecture
Create a convolutional neural network model to efficiently process images generated from genomic mutation frequency distributions, aimed at classifying various cancer types and healthy tissues.
## Genomic Image Generation
Implement algorithms to transform genomic mutation frequency data into visual representations, which will serve as input for the convolutional neural network.
## Comprehensive Sample Analysis
Curate a dataset comprising both cancerous and healthy genomic samples. Generate mutation frequency distribution tables for each sample and develop algorithms to exclude genomic regions that show no variations.
